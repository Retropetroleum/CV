      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I’m Gaius, an Economics student, private tutor, YouTuber and founder of the Lazy Student Academy. My skills are largely finance related (with video production, data science and web development thrown into the mix). My passion is trying to
        help myself and others lead more intentional and effective lives.</p>

      <p>I also write a weekly newsletter where I share insights on things I’ve learnt about effective learning, entrepreneurship, content creation, personal finance as well as career-building. Do check it out if you’re into that kinda stuff!</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Where's my portfolio? You're looking at it. This website is the first one I've built and I could help you do the same. At a low rate, you could have a website that impresses your employers and shows off your skills, truly setting yourself apart from the rest. I won't just build you the site, I'll recommend you the best webhosting and domain name services at the time you engage me and I'll even give you advice on how to make your website stand out to employers.</p>

        <h3>Private Tuition</h3>
        <p>I've helped over 20 students achieve their desired grades in PSLE and O-Level English as well as A-level Economics. I can help you do the same. As the son of an MOE trained teacher, I've always been curious about the art of learning. I took it to an extreme during National Service where I consumed multiple books and taught myself an assortment of skills. My deep understanding of the learning process has allowed me to repeatedly achieve most improvement awards during my national exams (which I studied last minute for lol)</p></p>
